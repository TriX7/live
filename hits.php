            <h1>Hits FM 91.2</h1>
            <p>
              For about three years until January 2005, Hits FM bought a three-hour slot in the national portal of Radio Nepal and broadcasted its programmes. When it obtained its licence to air independently, it became the first commercial radio channel in the country. Today, it is the most popular FM station in Nepal.Radio Kantipur is popular for its well-crafted programmes, some of which provide information and entertainment while others report news and provide timely updates on developing stories. It is technically sound and its creative team-members work hard to retain the trust of Nepali listeners. The gamut of programme formats runs from call-ins to bulletins, interviews and narratives. Hits FM hosts popular programmes such as ‘Kantipur Diary’, ‘The Headliners’ and ‘Yo Maya Bhanne Chij Yestai Ho’ among hundreds of others which seek to empower and connect Nepalis.
